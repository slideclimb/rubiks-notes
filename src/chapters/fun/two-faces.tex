\section{Turning Only the \rr R and \rr U faces}
Using only rotations of $180$ degrees, the only useful thing we can do is the sequence \rr R2, \rr U2, which consists of the cycles
\begin{align*}
    &(frd, flu, bru) &&(fr, br)\\
    &(fur, bdr, bul) &&(fu, bu)\\
    & &&(ul, ur, dr)\,.
\end{align*}
Doing this three times results in the corners being in their start position, and two pairs of swapped edge cubies: $(fr, br) (fu, bu)$.

Using rotations of $90$ degrees also, we can do a lot more.
The cycles of the \rr R move are
\[
    (rfu, rub, rbd, rdf)(rf, ru, rb, rd)
\] and of the \rr U move they are
\[
    (urf, ufl, ulb, ubr)(uf, ul, ub, ur)\,.
\]
We can scramble the cube using just these two operations, and things get surprisingly complicated.
