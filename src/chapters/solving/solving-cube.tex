\chapter{Solving the Cube}
We will attempt to write the beginners method~\cite{youcandothecube} down so that it is easier to remember.
In every step we will specify a goal, and an explanation how to get from the goal of the previous step to the current goal.
We do this by showing a cube with some short explanatory text that should make it easier to remember what to turn next, then showing the turns, and then the next state of the cube, etc.
