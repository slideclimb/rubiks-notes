\subsection{Yellow Cross}

\RubikCubeGreyAll
\RubikFaceUp XYX YYY XYX

\begin{goal}[\DrawRubikFaceUp]
    Solve the yellow cross.
    The edges of the yellow cubies on the other faces do not have to match the colour of that face.
    We will fix this later.
\end{goal}

\subsection{Yellow Corners}
\RubikCubeGreyAll
\RubikFaceUp YYY YYY YYY

\begin{goal}[\DrawRubikFaceUp]
    Solve the yellow corners.
    These also do not have to match the colours of the other faces (yet).
\end{goal}
